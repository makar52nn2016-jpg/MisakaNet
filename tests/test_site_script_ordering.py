"""A top-level call that reaches a `const` declared below it is a temporal dead zone — and it is silent.

The site hit this class twice on 2026-09-30. The homepage's stats card rendered "—" for **every** counter
because `loadLessons();` ran ~450 lines above `const LESSONS_LITE_URL`, so the page threw
`ReferenceError: Cannot access 'LESSONS_LITE_URL' before initialization`, the corpus never loaded, and the
"Frontend Shield" banner told the visitor the feed "contains anomalies or failed to load". The search page
reported the same message from its own cached copy of the same change.

The first rule written for this was too narrow: it compared one entry-point string (`loadLessons();`,
`init();`) against the declaration in **two** files, and looked at nothing under `docs/js/`. It also could not
have caught the real shape, because the top-level call did not mention the constant at all — it called a
function that called a function that read it.

This rule models that: for every script the site ships, it builds a tiny call graph, finds the functions that
(transitively) read a corpus-URL constant, and fails if any **top-level** call to one of them precedes the
declaration. Top-level means an unindented line, which is the style every one of these scripts uses.

Stated limits, so nobody trusts it further than it goes: it does not follow calls through objects or
callbacks (`addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', init)` is invisible to it), it reads only `const`/`let`
declarations at column 0, and it cannot see a hazard inside an indented block that a top-level statement
enters. It is a lint for one repeated mistake, not a JS semantics checker.
