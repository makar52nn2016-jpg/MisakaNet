"""Publish the onboarding funnel weekly: installs in, agent calls out.

**Why this exists instead of a download count.** Measured 2026-09-30/10-01, the two npm numbers are not
comparable and not human: `misakanet` (the plugin/bundle) is re-fetched on every install and update, while
`@misaka-net/misakanet-setup` is run once per machine and then served from npx's cache — and its "monthly
1,814" was one week (09-14: 1,661) that no workflow of ours produced. GitHub's own 14-day traffic says the
same thing from another angle: **3,079 unique cloners against 689 unique visitors**, i.e. machines clone 4.5×
more often than people look, while the MCP endpoint answers ~7,600 calls a day. Downloads measure one moment
of a pipeline; what matters is whether an install becomes an agent that actually searches.

So this writes **one snapshot** with the three legs side by side:

* `downloads` — npm weekly, per package (the funnel's top);
* `activity` — today's `mcp` / `agent` / `crawler` / `pageview` counts from the site's own projection
  (the funnel's bottom: is anyone calling?);
* `traffic` — GitHub's 14-day clones/views (context: how much of the clone number is even human). This
  leg needs a token that can read `/repos/*/traffic/*`, i.e. **Administration: read** — `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  cannot hold that permission, so the workflow must pass `GH_TOKEN`. Without it the leg is absent, the
  `window` block says so (rather than claiming `14d` for a measurement nobody took), and the run emits a
  `::warning::` naming the reason.

and one derived number, `mcp_per_weekly_install`: agent calls per week divided by installer downloads per
week. It is a **proxy, not a conversion rate** (both terms are noisy: npx caching suppresses the
denominator, and one agent makes many calls), which is why the badge shows the raw pair and this file keeps
the arithmetic.

**Publishing rule** (the same one `badges/install.json` follows): a number that could not be measured is not
published. If npm or the activity projection is unreachable, nothing is written and the run says why.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/snapshot_onboarding.py --out /tmp/badges/onboarding.json
    python3 scripts/snapshot_onboarding.py --out -            # print only, write nothing
    python3 scripts/snapshot_onboarding.py --out - --no-traffic
